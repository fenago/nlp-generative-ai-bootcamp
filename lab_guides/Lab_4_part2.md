# Introduction 

In the digital age, the ability to convert text into spoken audio has
numerous applications, from making content more accessible to creating
engaging multimedia experiences. OpenAI's Audio API harnesses advanced
text-to-speech (TTS) technology, offering a user-friendly interface to
generate realistic voiceovers. With six unique voices and support for
multiple languages, this tool is ideal for various use cases, including
blog narration, multilingual audio production, and real-time streaming.

# Key Features 

- Six Distinct Voices: Alloy, Echo, Fable, Onyx, Nova, Shimmer.
- Multiple Language Support: Follows Whisper model's language capabilities.
- Real-Time Audio Streaming: Utilizes chunk transfer encoding.
- Variety of Output Formats: MP3, Opus, AAC, FLAC.

# Lab Solution

Solution notebook for this lab can be found at `~/work/nlp-generative-ai-bootcamp/Lab04/openai_audio_api.ipynb`


# Initial Setup 

Start by importing the necessary module and setting up your OpenAI API
key:

```
import os

# Prompt for the API key
api_key = input("Enter your OpenAI API key: ")

# Set the environment variable
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = api_key
```


# Import Libraries 

Once the SDK is installed, import the required libraries, prep the data
and call the model:

```
from pathlib import Path
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()
speech_file_path = Path("speech.mp3")
response = client.audio.speech.create(
  model="tts-1",
  voice="alloy",
  input="My name is Dr. Lee and I am a Data Analytics Professor at Miami Dade College.  I am trying this ChatGPT model for the first time and it is super cool!"
)
response.stream_to_file(speech_file_path)
from IPython.display import Audio

# Play the generated audio file
Audio("/content/speech.mp3")
```

# Explanation 

- `client.audio.speech.create()`: Main function for speech generation.
- `model`: "tts-1" for standard quality, "tts-1-hd" for high definition.
- `voice`: Choose from the six available options.
- `input`: Your text to be converted into speech.
- `response.stream_to_file()`: Saves the audio to the specified path.

audio with OpenAI!

# Addendum: Translating and Generating Audio in English and Spanish in Google Colab 

# Preparing the English Text 

Store your English text in a variable named `my_speech`:

```
my_speech = """
My name is Dr. Lee and I am a Data Analytics Professor at Miami Dade College. 
I am trying this ChatGPT model for the first time and it is super cool!
"""
```

# Translating the Text to Spanish Using OpenAI API 

Use the OpenAI API to translate `my_speech` to
Spanish:

```
# Ensure the OpenAI library is installed
!pip install --upgrade openai

import openai

# Translate the English text to Spanish
response = openai.Completion.create(
  model="text-davinci-003",
  prompt="Translate the following text to Spanish: {}".format(my_speech),
  max_tokens=100
)

# Extract the translated text
my_speech_es = response.choices[0].text.strip()
```

# Generating Audio in English and Spanish 

Generate audio files for both the original English text and its Spanish
translation.

```
# Import the necessary library
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

# Generate English audio
response_en = client.audio.speech.create(
    model="tts-1",
    voice="alloy",
    input=my_speech
)
response_en.stream_to_file("english_speech.mp3")

# Generate Spanish audio
response_es = client.audio.speech.create(
    model="tts-1",
    voice="alloy",  # Choose a voice suitable for Spanish
    input=my_speech_es
)
response_es.stream_to_file("spanish_speech.mp3")
```

# Playing the Audio Files 

Play the generated audio files using IPython's Audio class.

```
from IPython.display import Audio

# Play the English audio
Audio("english_speech.mp3")

# Play the Spanish audio
Audio("spanish_speech.mp3")
```

This process allows you to translate text into Spanish using the OpenAI
API and then generate audio in both languages in a Google Colab
environment. It's a practical way to create bilingual audio content for
various applications, enhancing both accessibility and engagement for
diverse audiences.
