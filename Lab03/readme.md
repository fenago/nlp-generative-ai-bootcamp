## Activity 3.01: Developing End-to-End Text Classifiers

In this activity, you will build an end-to-end text classifier to determine whether a news article is political or not.

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python programming.
- Familiarity with machine learning concepts and text processing.

### Data

The dataset for this activity is available at the following link: [news_political_dataset.csv](https://github.com/fenago/nlp-generative-ai-bootcamp/blob/master/Lab03/data/news_political_dataset.csv).

### Steps to Follow

1. **Import Necessary Packages**:
   - Import Python libraries required for data handling, text processing, machine learning, and evaluation (such as `pandas`, `sklearn`, `nltk`, etc.).

2. **Read and Clean the Dataset**:
   - Load the `news_political_dataset.csv` file.
   - Perform necessary data cleaning and preprocessing steps.

3. **Create a TFIDF Matrix**:
   - Transform the text data into a TFIDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) matrix for feature extraction.

4. **Divide Data into Training and Validation Sets**:
   - Split the dataset into training and validation sets to train and evaluate the model.

5. **Develop Classifier Models**:
   - Implement different classifier models (like Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.) suitable for the dataset.

6. **Evaluate the Models**:
   - Use evaluation metrics such as confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and plot curve to assess the performance of the classifiers.

### Challenge for Students

After building a text classifier, take your skills further with these tasks:

- **Experiment with Different Datasets**: Try classifying texts from other domains, like customer reviews or social media posts.
- **Explore Different Features and Models**: Experiment with different feature extraction techniques (like word embeddings) and classifier algorithms.
- **Perform Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tune your models to achieve better performance.
- **Understand the Results**: Analyze the misclassifications to understand the limitations of your model and how it can be improved.

**Reflect on Real-World Applications**: Consider how text classification can be used in areas like sentiment analysis, topic categorization, or spam detection.
