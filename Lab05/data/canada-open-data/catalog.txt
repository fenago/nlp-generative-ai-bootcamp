This data can be used to estimate region-specific background soil concentrations, particularly for metals, in areas where naturally occurring concentrations exceed the soil quality guidelines established by the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME). Other jurisdictions, such as British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec have existing soils databases and EC determined that a similar database for the Atlantic region would be useful.  The background soils database allows for the screening of site data to determine if it is within the typical background range."

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA) tests foods for pesticides to detect food safety risks and ensure that the food supply meets Canadian standards.

The CFIA tested 3188 samples from a variety of imported and domestic food products for residues of the herbicide, Glyphosate. This was done to see what levels of residues were in these products and to verify that the levels of residues found meet Canadian guidelines. The results obtained from the testing were compared to the limits set by Health Canada.

The results of the survey showed that 70.3% of samples tested did not contain detectable residues of Glyphosate. The overall sample compliance rate to Canadian standards for Glyphosate was found to be 98.7%. None of the samples of fruits and vegetables or children's food products were found to contain residue levels which exceeded limits. Non-compliance data were evaluated by Health Canada and no human health concerns were identified. The CFIA will continue to monitor for the presence of this commonly used herbicide to ensure the safety of the Canadian food supply.

Kernel density analysis was used to identify high concentrations and the area occupied by successive catch weight thresholds was used to identify aggregations. These analyses were performed for each of the five biogeographic zones of eastern Canada. The largest sea pen fields were found in the Laurentian Channel as it cuts through the Gulf of St. Lawrence, while large gorgonian coral forests were found in the Eastern Arctic and on the northern Labrador continental slope. Large ball-shaped Geodia spp. sponges were located along the continental slopes north of the Grand Banks, while on the Scotian Shelf a unique population of the large barrel-shaped sponge Vazella pourtalesi was identified. The latitude and longitude marking the positions of all tows which form these and other dense aggregations are provided along with the positions of all tows which captured black coral, a non-aggregating taxon which is long-lived and vulnerable to fishing pressures.  These polygons identify sponge grounds from the broader distribution of sponges in the region as sampled by Cosmos gear in the Eastern Arctic biogeographic zone. A 40 kg minimum threshold for the sponge catch was identified as the weight that separated the sponge ground habitat from the broader distribution of sponges with these research vessel tow data and gear type."

Multibeam bathymetry surveys use sonar to map the seafloor. Sound is transmitted toward the seabed in beams formed using an array of piezoelectric transducers and as the vessel moves through the water, the acoustic signals or ""pings"" bounce back off the seabed returning up to the water surface where they are detected by the transducer and recorded on board. Measurement of acoustic velocity variations in the water column permit conversion of  ""ping"" return time to water depth. Compilation and processing of these soundings within a Geographic Information System (GIS) yields a 3-dimensional digital elevation model (DEM) of the seafloor. The individual surveys cover areas of particular interest to the marine geoscientists at the Geological Survey of Canada (Atlantic)."

2305,"This purpose of this project is to study how food webs influence the transfer of contaminants to the top predator, landlocked Arctic char, in the Northern Contaminants Program's (NCP) ""focal ecosystem"" lakes on Cornwallis Island. Previous studies have shown that mercury and perfluorinated chemicals are carried into Arctic lakes during spring melt and are taken up and concentrated through the food web into char. This research examined food web accumulation of mercury, which has both natural and human sources and undergoes complex transformations in lakes, and of perfluorinated chemicals, which are entirely human-made, arrive solely by atmospheric deposition, and are not transformed in the environment. We built on previous research by contrasting how these two persistent contaminants concentrate through lake food webs and examining factors that affect their levels in char and other organisms in High Arctic lakes. The research focused on lakes in the Resolute Bay area (North, Small, Meretta, Resolute, 9 Mile, Char), because the arctic char and the supporting food webs of these lakes hd already been studied."

2071,"Long-lived pollutants continue to be found in Arctic air and water as a result of distant and local sources.  One objective of this project is to establish current concentrations of priority pollutants so future concentrations can be compared.  Marine traffic, mining and oil/gas exploration is expected to increase in the archipelago and could impact levels of contaminants in air and water.  Some of these pollutants include flame retardants, pesticides and chemicals released when burning fuels.  
Some local sources of these chemicals in the Arctic are from diesel burning for electricity (diesel is burned in Nunavut’s 25 hamlets to produce electricity), diesel burning ships, local oil exploration, forest fires and long range transport from southern regions.  As other long-lived pollutants decline due to regulations, chemicals from fuel burning may become a more important pollutant in the arctic environment.
Another important set of chemicals in the arctic are flame retardants, they are receiving increased attention due to their presence in the arctic environment.  Flame retardants are used mainly in furniture, foam, textiles and fire resistant coatings but some are also used in plastics, hydraulic fluids, lacquer/paint, glue and cosmetics.  As some flame retardants are banned, the use of other flame retardants will increase. The goal of this work is to determine how existing and new long-lived pollutants are transported to the arctic, what happens to them once they are there, and how they enter the food web.  We propose to achieve this through air and water sampling in the Canadian Archipelago in collaboration with the ArcticNet program onboard the Canadian Coast Guard Ship Amundsen.  Please see Figure 1 for the ship’s cruise track.  This study will build on air and water investigations conducted by the same team since 1992 but looking at a broader range of chemicals. 
New to the project this year are brominated product compounds (BPCs).  They are naturally occurring but are also degradation products of brominated anthropogenic compounds such as poly brominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). These compounds are present in arctic biota and the brominated dioxins have toxicological significance. Additionally, these are potential climate change indicators, since the retreat of sea ice, changes in precipitation and river runoff is predicted to change the distribution of these brominated compounds due to changes in primary production, species composition, circulation patterns, formation of the water column structure, load of dissolved organic matter and air-sea exchange. We propose to collect water, air and sediment samples for these compounds since little is known about their presence in the arctic abiotic environment. 

Results of this research, combined with those from earlier studies, will allow us to assess changes in pollutant levels in the Canadian Archipelago over time.  Our monitoring work helps us determine the effectiveness of Canadian and international regulations to reduce emissions of certain long-lived pollutants.  Our work also helps us understand how a changing climate influences how these chemicals move in the environment.  The information we collect on levels of new chemicals in Arctic air and water, including new flame retardants, will be used to determine whether or not they should be banned world-wide."

The analysis is based on precipitation and temperature values interpolated every 10 km using the ANUSPLIN method, based on data from the Ministère du Développement durable, de l'Environnement et des Parcs du Québec and from Environment Canada.Evapotranspiration corresponds to the loss of water from the soil and plant cover by evaporation, and the loss of water from plants through transpiration.The potential evapotranspiration index (ETP) is based on the principle that the growth of a crop is optimal when the usable water reserve is sufficient and there is a balance between water absorbed by the roots and water lost through transpiration. The ETP corresponds to the maximum theoretical possible evaporation and transpiration in given climate conditions. The accumulated difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (P-ETP) gives a general indication of the “climatological” water balance and can be used to make qualitative comparisons between regions in terms of irrigation requirements and risks of drought. However, a specific assessment of water needs for a given culture and a specific location requires knowledge of the actual evapotranspiration which, in addition to climatological factors, also takes into account the characteristics of the plant and the soil."

2902,"Canada is the world’s fifth largest producer of natural gas and accounts for around five per cent of global production. Natural gas production in Canada is predominantly from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan, although other gas is produced from offshore Nova Scotia and smaller amounts are produced in Ontario, New Brunswick, and Nunavut. While Canadian production of conventional natural gas has been declining, production of Canadian unconventional natural gas has been rising. Development of unconventional resources like tight gas is technologically challenging and companies are increasingly using horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to create economically viable wells. Canadian natural gas supply currently exceeds domestic consumption. Canada’s natural gas markets are heavily integrated with those of the United States and Canada exports its surplus natural gas to the U.S. while importing smaller amounts from the U.S. into Central Canada in return. While some companies have proposed exporting natural gas to overseas markets by liquefying it (liquefied natural gas or LNG), any projects that are actually built are not likely to be operational until towards the end of the decade. The National Energy Board regulates the export and import of natural gas. Export orders or licenses are required to export natural gas from Canada.

In order to use the data, the file must be loaded into an existing database or information system provided by the user. The Canada Vigilance Adverse Reaction Online Database contains information about suspected adverse reactions (also known as side effects) to health products, captured from adverse reaction reports submitted to Health Canada by consumers and health professionals, who submit reports voluntarily, as well as by market authorization holders (manufacturers and distributors), who are required to submit reports according to the Food and Drugs Regulations. Information concerning vaccines used for immunization have only been included in the database since January 1, 2011. Indication data has recently been added to the data extract files and the Detailed Adverse Reaction Report. Indication refers to the particular condition for which a health product was taken. For example, diabetes is an indication for insulin. Health products are often authorised for use in treating more than one indication. Note: The database cannot be used on its own to evaluate a health product's safety profile. It does not provide conclusive information on the safety of health products, and is not a substitute for medical advice.

Natural gas production in Canada is predominantly from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan, although other gas is produced from offshore Nova Scotia and smaller amounts are produced in Ontario, New Brunswick, and Nunavut. While Canadian production of conventional natural gas has been declining, production of Canadian unconventional natural gas has been rising. Development of unconventional resources like tight gas is technologically challenging and companies are increasingly using horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to create economically viable wells. Canadian natural gas supply currently exceeds domestic consumption. Canada’s natural gas markets are heavily integrated with those of the United States and Canada exports its surplus natural gas to the U.S. while importing smaller amounts from the U.S. into Central Canada in return. While some companies have proposed exporting natural gas to overseas markets by liquefying it (liquefied natural gas or LNG), any projects that are actually built are not likely to be operational until towards the end of the decade. The National Energy Board regulates the export and import of natural gas. Export orders or licenses are required to export natural gas from Canada.

Field sampling of 95 pre-selected lakes for surface water quality, plankton and fish populations, as well as 35 lakes for surface water samples only, was under taken from l6 August to 20 October 1982. All intensively sampled lakes were initially sounded for mean depth and volume calculations by conducting representative transects. A vertical profile of temperature-dissolved oxygen was obtained at maximum lake depth, together with a simultaneous recording of Secchi disc penetration. Discrete water samples were collected for the field determination of pH, alkalinity, conductivity and free carbon dioxide. Analysis of additional water quality variables was performed in the laboratory, including a major ion balance, nutrients, colour, turbidity, dissolved organic carbon and aluminum. Vertical net plank ton tows were carried out at each sampling location, and nannoplankton samples were also collected. Bottom and/or surface floating gillnet gangs were set in every lake. Fork length, weight, sex and maturity were determined for individual fish. Scales or otoliths were removed for aging. Purposes, and fin rays were also collected from certain species. All fish were aged and successive scale annuli measured to determine back calculated growth. Sections of dorso-lateral fish tissue were removed from a representative number of type species at each lake and analyzed for mercury and aluminum concentrations.

3019,"Data include a collection of annual land cover maps derived from MODIS 250 m spatial resolution remotely sensed imagery for the period 2000 to 2011. Processing of the time series was designed to reduce the occurrence of false change between maps. The method was based on change updating as described in Pouliot et al. (2011, 2013). Change detection accounted for both abrupt changes such as forest harvesting and more gradual changes such as recurrent insect defoliation. To determine the new label for a pixel identified as change, an evidential reasoning approach was used to combine spectral and contextual information. The 2005 MODIS land cover of Canada at 250 m spatial resolution described in Latifovic et al. (2012) was used as the base map. It contains 39 land cover classes, which for time series development was considered too detailed and was reduced to 25 and 19 class versions. The 25 class version corresponds to the North America Land Change Monitoring System (NALCMS) Level 2 legend as described in Latifovic et al. (2012). Accuracy assessment of time series is difficult due to the need to assess many maps. For areas of change in the time series accuracy was found to be 70% based on the 25 class thematic legend."

1238,"Polygons denoting concentrations of sea pens, small and large gorgonian corals and sponges on the east coast of Canada have been identified through spatial analysis of research vessel survey by-catch data following an approach used by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) in the Regulatory Area (NRA) on Flemish Cap and southeast Grand Banks. Kernel density analysis was used to identify high concentrations and the area occupied by successive catch weight thresholds was used to identify aggregations. These analyses were performed for each of the five biogeographic zones of eastern Canada. The largest sea pen fields were found in the Laurentian Channel as it cuts through the Gulf of St. Lawrence, while large gorgonian coral forests were found in the Eastern Arctic and on the northern Labrador continental slope. Large ball-shaped Geodia spp. sponges were located along the continental slopes north of the Grand Banks, while on the Scotian Shelf a unique population of the large barrel-shaped sponge Vazella pourtalesi was identified. The latitude and longitude marking the positions of all tows which form these and other dense aggregations are provided along with the positions of all tows which captured black coral, a non-aggregating taxon which is long-lived and vulnerable to fishing pressures.  These polygons identify sponge grounds from the broader distribution of sponges in the Southern Gulf region as sampled by Western II A gear in the Gulf biogeographic zone. A 3 kg minimum threshold for the sponge catch was identified as the weight that separated the sponge ground habitat from the broader distribution of sponges with these research vessel tow data and gear type."

They are found in coastal waters of the northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as well as those of the Baltic and North Seas. In Canada, they may be found off the coastal waters of British Columbia, Nunavut, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador.

Population trends and abundance of harbour seals in British Columbia are assessed based on aerial surveys conducted during 1966-2016. Based on counts conducted in Index Areas distributed throughout the province, the trend observed in the Strait of Georgia appears to be indicative of harbour seal populations throughout British Columbia. Total abundance of harbour seals on the B.C. coast in 2008 was estimated to be on the order of about 105,000 (95% confidence interval of 90,900 to 118,900) seals. Historic reconstructions indicate the population was depleted by a period of commercial harvesting during 1879-1914, and subsequently maintained below natural levels by predator control programs until the early 1960s. Already depleted, the population could not sustain a second period of intense commercial harvesting during 1962-1968 and was further depleted, but now appears to have fully recovered"

2. Assess historical deposition (including deposition rates) of selected oil sands contaminants from water-bodies within 50 km of major up-grader facilities in the OS region (near-field) and from water-bodies distant from the up-graders (far-field), and determine whether there are chemical markers of anthropogenic emissions.

Kernel density analysis was used to identify high concentrations and the area occupied by successive catch weight thresholds was used to identify aggregations. These analyses were performed for each of the five biogeographic zones of eastern Canada. The largest sea pen fields were found in the Laurentian Channel as it cuts through the Gulf of St. Lawrence, while large gorgonian coral forests were found in the Eastern Arctic and on the northern Labrador continental slope. Large ball-shaped Geodia spp. sponges were located along the continental slopes north of the Grand Banks, while on the Scotian Shelf a unique population of the large barrel-shaped sponge Vazella pourtalesi was identified. The latitude and longitude marking the positions of all tows which form these and other dense aggregations are provided along with the positions of all tows which captured black coral, a non-aggregating taxon which is long-lived and vulnerable to fishing pressures.  These polygons identify sponge grounds from the broader distribution of sponges in the Northern Gulf region as sampled by Campelen gear in the Gulf biogeographic zone. A 2 kg minimum threshold for the sponge catch was identified as the weight that separated the sponge ground habitat from the broader distribution of sponges with these research vessel tow data and gear type."

These measurements were conducted to: 1. determine a long term trend in background ozone, and 2. to understand the annual appearance of surface level ozone depletions that start in mid-March ( just after the time of polar sunrise) and extend into June.  Ozone depletion events have also been correlated with atmospheric mercury depletion events.  Many field studies have been carried out at Alert to unravel the reason for this phenomenon.  As a result, accurate measurements of ozone has been of crucial importance. 

O3 was measured with a commercial Thermo Environmental Instruments Model 49 instrument based on the principle of ultraviolet absorption by O3.  Calibrations were performed approximately every 2 months and were referenced to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, (NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland, U.S.A).  Calibrations were usually within 1% of the mean calibration factor and it is estimated that the final hourly corrected O3 mixing ratios are accurate to within ± 2% or ± 1 ppb, whichever is greater."

1534,"Daily sea surface temperature and salinity observations have been carried out at several locations on the coast of British Columbia since the early part of the 20th century. Observations started at the Pacific Biological Station (Departure Bay) in 1914, 11 stations were added in the mid-1930s and several more in the 1960s. The number of stations reporting at any given time has varied as sampling has been discontinued at some stations, and started or resumed at others. Presently termed the British Columbia Shore Station Oceanographic Program (BCSOP), there are 13 participating stations. Most of the stations are at lighthouses staffed by Fisheries and Oceans Canada, but three (Race Rocks, Amphitrite Point, and Active Pass) are sampled by contracted observers. This collection includes data from the Lighthouse sampling stations that are presently active or were sampled quite recently. Warning The daily sampling strategy at the BC Lighthouse Stations was designed long ago by Dr. John P. Tully. We have chosen not to change the strategy in the interests of a homogeneous data set. Sampling occurs at or near the daytime high tide. This means, for example, that if an observer starts sampling one day at 6 a.m.(local time), and continues to sample at the daytime hightide, as instructed, then on the 2nd day he/she will take samples at about 06:50 the next day, 07:40 the day after etc. When the daytime high tide gets close to 6 p.m. then it snaps back to 6 a.m. and the cycle starts again. Since there is a diurnal signal in sea-surface temperature the sampling creates a 14-day signal as an artifact."

Natural gas production in Canada is predominantly from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan, although other gas is produced from offshore Nova Scotia and smaller amounts are produced in Ontario, New Brunswick, and Nunavut. While Canadian production of conventional natural gas has been declining, production of Canadian unconventional natural gas has been rising. Development of unconventional resources like tight gas is technologically challenging and companies are increasingly using horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to create economically viable wells. Canadian natural gas supply currently exceeds domestic consumption. Canada’s natural gas markets are heavily integrated with those of the United States and Canada exports its surplus natural gas to the U.S. while importing smaller amounts from the U.S. into Central Canada in return. While some companies have proposed exporting natural gas to overseas markets by liquefying it (liquefied natural gas or LNG), any projects that are actually built are not likely to be operational until towards the end of the decade. The National Energy Board regulates the export and import of natural gas. Export orders or licenses are required to export natural gas from Canada. Holders of export authorizations report monthly on their export activities to the Board."

 The report also shows the total count of permit holders and refugee claimants with valid permit(s) in each calendar year and the total count of permit holders and refugee claimants as at December 31st of each year. The main body of the publication consists of a series of statistical tables and charts covering the ten-year period from 2006 to 2015.
 In Facts & Figures 2015 for Temporary Residents, numbers on International Mobility Program (IMP) Work Permit Holders for Work Purposes increased due to the moving of the Post-graduate Employment Work Permit Holders population from Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes to Work Permit Holders for Work Purposes under the International Mobility Program. As a result of this, the Facts & Figures 2015 reports reflect a corresponding decrease in the number of Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes. These changes have been applied retroactively.
 The Post-Graduation Work Permit Program (PGWPP) allows students who have graduated from a participating Canadian post-secondary institution to gain valuable Canadian work experience. Skilled Canadian work experience gained through the PGWPP potentially helps graduates qualify for permanent residence in Canada through the Canadian Experience Class (CEC). 

Facts & Figures 2013 had previously counted those who held Post-Graduation Work Permits as Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes. However, Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes is a category for individuals who are primarily students and who are also allowed to get a work permit (e.g., Co-op students) because it is integral to their course of studies. To get a PGWP, in contrast, an individual must have ceased to be a student – it is a requirement that the individual must have graduated from their program."

The purpose of collecting air and water samples in the Canadian Archipelago was i) to continue the time trends of OCPs and CUPs, ii) to confirm the presence of PFAS observed in recent years and iii) establish baseline concentrations of OPs.  The phytoplankton and zooplankton samples investigation will allow quantification of the above compounds in the lower food web and observe how these compounds move from the abiotic to biotic environment.  
Four OPs, tri-phenyl phosphate (TPP); tris-(2-chloro ethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris-(2-chloro propyl) phosphate (TCPP) and tris-(1,2-dichloro propyl) phosphate (TDCPP) were identified in air samples for the first time in Canadian arctic air and levels are very high compared to levels of S-PBDEs and other brominated flame retardants at Alert (Xiao et al., 2012).

1180,"Catch, effort, location (latitude, longitude), relative abundance indices, and associated biological data from groundfish multi-species bottom trawl surveys in West Coast Haida Gwaii. Introduction - The West Coast Haida Gwaii (WCHG) synoptic bottom trawl survey was first conducted annually from 2006 to 2008 and has since been repeated every second year on even numbered years. This survey is one of a set of long-term and coordinated surveys that together cover the continental shelf and upper slope of most of the British Columbia coast. The other surveys are the Queen Charlotte Sound (QCS) survey, the Hecate Strait (HS) survey, the West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) survey, and the Strait of Georgia (SOG) survey. The objectives of these surveys are to provide fishery independent abundance indices of all demersal fish species available to bottom trawling and to collect biological samples of selected species. The survey follows a random depth-stratified design and the sampling units are 2 km by 2 km blocks. The synoptic bottom trawl surveys are conducted by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) in collaboration with the Canadian Groundfish Research and Conservation Society (CGRCS), a non-profit society composed of participants in the British Columbia commercial groundfish trawl fishery. The Queen Charlotte Sound and West Coast Haida Gwaii surveys are conducted under collaborative agreements, with the CGRCS providing chartered commercial fishing vessels and field technicians, while DFO provides in-kind contributions for running the surveys including personnel and equipment. The Hecate Strait, West Coast Vancouver Island, and Strait of Georgia surveys are conducted by DFO and have typically taken place on the Canadian Coast Guard research vessel W.E. Ricker. In years when the W.E. Ricker has not been available, the Hecate Strait and West Coast Vancouver Island surveys have taken place on chartered industry vessels. Effort - This table contains information about the survey trips and fishing events (trawl tows/sets) that are part of this survey series. Trip-level information includes the year the survey took place, a unique trip identifier, the vessel that conducted the survey, and the trip start and end dates (the dates the vessel was away from the dock conducting the survey). Set-level information includes the date, time, location, and depth that fishing took place, as well as information that can be used to calculate fishing effort (duration) and swept area. All successful fishing events are included, regardless of what was caught. Catch - This table contains the catch information from successful fishing events. Catches are identified to species or to the lowest taxonomic level possible. Most catches are weighed, but some are too small (“trace” amounts) or too large (e.g. very large Big Skate). The unique trip identifier and set number are included so that catches can be related to the fishing event information (including capture location). Biology - This table contains the available biological data for catches which were sampled. Data may include any or all of length, sex, weight, age. Different length types are measured depending on the species. Age structures are collected when possible for species where validated aging methods exist and are archived until required for an assessment; therefore, all existing structures have not been aged at this time. The unique trip identifier and set number are included so that samples can be related to the fishing event and catch information. Biomass - This table contains relative biomass indices of species that have been captured in every survey of the time series. The coefficient of variation and bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals are provided for each index.

Membership in the consortium was on a subscription basis and the database was exclusive to members of the consortium. The GSC played a relatively passive role, but had a fundamental role in the early days of the consortium's over 30 year history. The amalgamation of oil companies and decline in supporting subscriptions led to the dissolution of PALYNODATA Inc. in 2007. To maintain accessibility of the PALYNODATA database, the GSC agreed to take over, house and provide public access to the database. The PALYNODATA database is the largest database of its kind in the world. The data is the result of abstracting from over 22,000 publications, and includes biostratigraphic, taxonomic, bibliographic and paleogeographic information. It has over a million individual records from over 122,000 different taxa (genera, species, etc). It was been published as Open FIle 5793 in 2008 and is no longer updated. "

1554,"Fish health on British Columbia salmon farms is managed throughout the production cycle to maintain healthy fish populations and to identify and address disease occurrences as soon as they arise. Aquaculture licence conditions set out mandatory monitoring and reporting requirements to ensure any impacts are appropriately mitigated at salmon farms. A central component of on-farm fish health management is a Fish Health Management Plan (FHMP). FHMPs are approved by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) and describe the fish health principles that the licensee must follow to maintain fish health and biosecurity at the farm. Licence holders must routinely submit a variety of fish health data to DFO. Routine reports include information on mortality rates, including the suspected cause of mortality. Additional reports are submitted if there are elevated mortalities or a fish health event that requires the involvement of a veterinarian. Both DFO and aquaculture companies have veterinarians on staff (or available on contract, for some companies) to monitor fish health on farms. Company veterinarians ensure appropriate husbandry in day-to-day operations and identify appropriate management measures if fish health concerns arise. Through the Fish Health Audit and Surveillance program, DFO oversees the health of cultured salmon to minimize fish health and disease risks to wild and farmed fish and publishes reports on regulation and monitoring of BC’s marine finfish aquaculture facilities. Sites are routinely inspected to ensure compliance with FHMPs, to verify the accuracy of industry reporting, and to collect samples for routine diagnostic disease screening. All salmon aquaculture transfers require authorization under section 56 of the Fishery (General) Regulations. Movements of fish to and from farms may be required to introduce new stock, facilitate growth at different life stages or optimize production. DFO reviews these applications to determine whether the movement may adversely affect local aquatic species and habitats. DFO veterinarians and biologists assess the information gathered by DFO and submitted by industry to gain a complete picture of the health status of the fish to be moved. For hatchery to marine transfers, this assessment also includes an in-depth records review and on-site inspection of the fish. If this assessment indicates that a pathogen or disease is affecting the fish to be transferred, DFO may place restrictions on the movement and/or prescribe additional conditions to mitigate any risk of disease transmission, such as grading to remove undersized fish, the use of pre-transfer medications, or additional post-transfer health testing. If no mitigation measure can be identified, the application will be denied."

2904,"Canada is the world’s fifth largest producer of natural gas and accounts for around five per cent of global production. Natural gas production in Canada is predominantly from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan, although other gas is produced from offshore Nova Scotia and smaller amounts are produced in Ontario, New Brunswick, and Nunavut. While Canadian production of conventional natural gas has been declining, production of Canadian unconventional natural gas has been rising. Development of unconventional resources like tight gas is technologically challenging and companies are increasingly using horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to create economically viable wells. Canadian natural gas supply currently exceeds domestic consumption. Canada’s natural gas markets are heavily integrated with those of the United States and Canada exports its surplus natural gas to the U.S. while importing smaller amounts from the U.S. into Central Canada in return. While some companies have proposed exporting natural gas to overseas markets by liquefying it (liquefied natural gas or LNG), any projects that are actually built are not likely to be operational until towards the end of the decade. The National Energy Board regulates the export and import of natural gas. Export orders or licenses are required to export natural gas from Canada. Holders of export authorizations report monthly on their export activities to the Board."

2103,"Fathead minnow embryos and larvae are frequently used in toxicology, including short-term embryo-only tests which often use small volumes of test solution. The effect that such conditions may have on fathead minnow development has yet to be explicitly described. Here we compared rates of embryonic development in fathead minnow embryos reared under standard light and temperature conditions with a range of possible methods. All methods yielded excellent control survival.  We demonstrated that fathead minnow embryos incubated in a range of small volumes in multi-well plates (500 μL to 2 mL per embryo) did not substantially vary in developmental rate, but flexed less frequently as embryos, hatched smaller, later and with larger yolk-sacs, and initiated feeding later than embryos reared in an excess of solution (20 mL per embryo) with or without supplemental aeration. Faster hatch and growth were promoted with an orbital shaker, but growth benefits were not sustained into the larval stage.  Developmental differences persisted in larvae reared to 20 days post-fertilization when monitoring ceased, but growth differences did not magnify and in some measurements partially resolved. To our knowledge we are the first to report effects of incubation in multi-well plates in any fish taxa. As our data revealed that the eleutheroembryonic stage for fathead minnow may be prolonged in multi-well plates, this may allow the use of longer toxicity tests using fathead minnow embryos without conflicting with existing animal welfare legislation in many countries.

The data file presents the individual length and weight to each fathead minnow fry at hatch."

It provides permafrost codes and their English and French language descriptions as well as information about the percentage of the polygon that the component occupies.
 Permafrost is defined as a state of the ground, whether soil or rock, that remains at or below a temperature of 0° C for long periods (NRC, Permafrost Subcommittee, 1988). The minimum period is from one winter, through the following summer, and into the next winter; however, most permafrost has existed for much longer. This formal definition considers only the temperature of the ground, and thus permafrost is a strictly thermal phenomenon, and not a material. At temperatures below 0° C , almost all of the soil moisture occurs in the form of ground ice. Ground ice usually exists at temperature close to its melting point and so is liable to melt if the ground warms. The extent and nature of permafrost, including estimated ice content and typical ground ice forms are derived from the map """"Canada - Permafrost"""" (Natural Resources Canada, 1995)."""

 The Post-Graduation Work Permit Program (PGWPP) allows students who have graduated from a participating Canadian post-secondary institution to gain valuable Canadian work experience. Skilled Canadian work experience gained through the PGWPP potentially helps graduates qualify for permanent residence in Canada through the Canadian Experience Class (CEC). 

Facts & Figures 2013 had previously counted those who held Post-Graduation Work Permits as Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes. However, Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes is a category for individuals who are primarily students and who are also allowed to get a work permit (e.g., Co-op students) because it is integral to their course of studies. To get a PGWP, in contrast, an individual must have ceased to be a student – it is a requirement that the individual must have graduated from their program."

2901,"Canada is the world’s fifth largest producer of natural gas and accounts for around five per cent of global production. Natural gas production in Canada is predominantly from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan; although other gas is produced from offshore Nova Scotia and smaller amounts are produced in Ontario, New Brunswick, and Nunavut. While Canadian production of conventional natural gas has been declining, production of Canadian unconventional natural gas has been rising. Development of unconventional resources like tight gas is technologically challenging and companies are increasingly using horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to create economically viable wells. Canadian natural gas supply currently exceeds domestic consumption. Canada’s natural gas markets are heavily integrated with those of the United States and Canada exports its surplus natural gas to the U.S. while importing smaller amounts from the U.S. into Central Canada in return. While some companies have proposed exporting natural gas to overseas markets by liquefying it (liquefied natural gas or LNG), any projects that are actually built are not likely to be operational until towards the end of the decade. The National Energy Board regulates the export and import of natural gas. Export orders or licenses are required to export natural gas from Canada. Holders of export authorizations report monthly on their export activities to the Board."

The survey consisted of approximately 790 square kilometers of coverage. While collecting the LiDAR data, we also acquired aerial photo in RGB and NIR modes consisting of 1649 frames each.In addition to the main area of interest, McElhanney has acquired some LiDAR and photo of low lying areas adjacent to the project area. This additional area was acquired on speculation that the data may be required in the future.The 3Dimensional laser returns (point cloud) were classified using Microstation (v8), Terrascan and TerraModeler. A series of algorithms based on topography were created to separate laser returns that hit the ground from the ones that hit objects above the ground.Steps taken are:Classified LiDAR surface as Bare earth, Classified other features as non-bare earth or default, Formatted to ASPRS .LAS V1.1 (Class 1 - Default (non-bare earth), Class 2 – Ground points (bare earth)), 239 tiles each 2km x2km generated for LiDAR data, File prefix FF – Classified (Non-Bare Earth and Bare Earth), File Prefix BE – Bare Earth only, Bare Earth Model Key Point (MKPts) surface files are thinned Bare earth LiDAR points.

768,"Facts and Figures 2015: Immigration Overview Temporary Residents presents the annual intake of permit holders and refugee claimants from 1994 to 2015.
 The report also shows the total count of permit holders and refugee claimants with valid permit(s) in each calendar year and the total count of permit holders and refugee claimants as at December 31st of each year. The main body of the publication consists of a series of statistical tables and charts covering the ten-year period from 2006 to 2015.
 In Facts & Figures 2015 for Temporary Residents, numbers on International Mobility Program (IMP) Work Permit Holders for Work Purposes increased due to the moving of the Post-graduate Employment Work Permit Holders population from Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes to Work Permit Holders for Work Purposes under the International Mobility Program. As a result of this, the Facts & Figures 2015 reports reflect a corresponding decrease in the number of Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes. These changes have been applied retroactively.
 The Post-Graduation Work Permit Program (PGWPP) allows students who have graduated from a participating Canadian post-secondary institution to gain valuable Canadian work experience. Skilled Canadian work experience gained through the PGWPP potentially helps graduates qualify for permanent residence in Canada through the Canadian Experience Class (CEC). 

Facts & Figures 2013 had previously counted those who held Post-Graduation Work Permits as Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes. However, Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes is a category for individuals who are primarily students and who are also allowed to get a work permit (e.g., Co-op students) because it is integral to their course of studies. To get a PGWP, in contrast, an individual must have ceased to be a student – it is a requirement that the individual must have graduated from their program."

2154,"The Integrated Atmospheric Deposition Network (IADN) has been in operation since 1990 under the guidance of an implementation plan signed in that year. The first implementation plan (IP1) committed the United States and Canada to work cooperatively towards the initiation of the IADN and guided the five cooperating IADN agencies (the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Environment Canada's Atmospheric Environment Service, National Water Research Institute, Ecosystem Health Division of Ontario Region; and the Ontario Ministry of Environment) in meeting their joint obligation.

IADN has succeeded in incorporating measurements of most of the chemicals on the target lists of IP1. The list of the target chemicals consists of PCBs (total and major congeners); hexachlorcyclohexanes (HCHs); DDT and its metabolites; chlordane, nonachlor, heptachlor epoxide, methoxychlor, dieldrin, HCB and endrin; trace metals such as Pb, As, Se, Cd; chlorinated benzenes, toxaphene, co-planar PCBs, dioxins and furans; new chemicals such as the triazine herbicides, industrial chemicals; and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). IADN has established one master station on each of the five Great Lakes: Eagle Harbor (USA) on Lake Superior, Sleeping Bear Dunes (USA) on Lake Michigan, Burnt Island (Canada) on Lake Huron, Sturgeon Point (USA) on Lake Erie and Pt. Petre (Canada) on Lake Ontario. There are also fourteen satellite stations that serve as a valuable source of information by extending the resolution capability of IADN."

The analysis is based on precipitation and temperature values interpolated every 10 km using the ANUSPLIN method, based on data from the Ministère du Développement durable, de l'Environnement et des Parcs du Québec and from Environment Canada.Evapotranspiration corresponds to the loss of water from the soil and plant cover by evaporation, and the loss of water from plants through transpiration.The potential evapotranspiration index (ETP) is based on the principle that the growth of a crop is optimal when the usable water reserve is sufficient and there is a balance between water absorbed by the roots and water lost through transpiration. The ETP corresponds to the maximum theoretical possible evaporation and transpiration in given climate conditions. The accumulated difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (P-ETP) gives a general indication of the “climatological” water balance and can be used to make qualitative comparisons between regions in terms of irrigation requirements and risks of drought. However, a specific assessment of water needs for a given culture and a specific location requires knowledge of the actual evapotranspiration which, in addition to climatological factors, also takes into account the characteristics of the plant and the soil."

Frost risk varies locally depending on a number of factors, particularly topography and proximity to a body of water. The first autumn frost is associated with the first day on which the minimum daily temperature is less than or equal to lethal temperature.

2584,"""This dataset provides the results obtained by two radiation monitoring networks operated by Health Canada: the Canadian monitoring sites of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the Canadian Radiological Monitoring Network (CRMN). More information about the CTBT and its monitoring network is available here: http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/contaminants/radiation/nuclea/index-eng.php and http://www.ctbto.org/. Further information on the CRMN network is available at: http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/contaminants/radiation/crmn-rcsr/index-eng.php. The results provided are activity concentration and uncertainty for various nuclides in the months following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident. Reported are the naturally occurring radionuclides: beryllium-7 (7Be) and lead-210 (210Pb), and all anthropogenic radionuclides observed: cesium-134 (134Cs), cesium-136 (136Cs), cesium-137 (137Cs), iodine-131 (131I), iodine-132 (132I), iodine-133 (133I), tellurium-129 (129Te), tellurium-129m (129mTe), tellurium-132 (132Te), technetium-99m (99mTc), lanthanum-140 (140La), and the radioactive gases: xenon-131m (131mXe), xenon-133 (133Xe), xenon-133m (133mXe), and xenon-135 (135Xe). The absence of data for a specific nuclide indicates that it was either below the detection threshold or absent. The data comes from the measurement and analysis of particulates accumulated in filter media or from xenon gas extracted from the atmosphere. Cascade summations corrections were applied to ensure reporting of the true physical relationships among the observed radionuclides. Throughout the accident period, the measured activity concentrations of all radionuclides represent only a small fraction of the typical annual background exposure from natural sources of radiation. Therefore, these levels do not present any risks to the health of Canadians. "" "

Frost risk varies locally depending on a number of factors, particularly topography and proximity to a body of water. The date of the last spring frost corresponds to the last day on which the minimum daily temperature was less than or equal to freezing temperature, i.e. a temperature low enough to damage vegetables. That temperature varies between 0 and -5 °C depending on the crop. Spring frost can cause significant damage to crops, depending on their phenological stage at the time of exposure. For several annual crops, the date of the last spring frost can help with decisions about seeding earlier and minimizing risks to crops.

The main body of the publication consists of a series of statistical tables and charts covering the ten-year period from 2006 to 2015.
 In Facts & Figures 2015 for Temporary Residents, numbers on International Mobility Program (IMP) Work Permit Holders for Work Purposes increased due to the moving of the Post-graduate Employment Work Permit Holders population from Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes to Work Permit Holders for Work Purposes under the International Mobility Program. As a result of this, the Facts & Figures 2015 reports reflect a corresponding decrease in the number of Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes. These changes have been applied retroactively.
 The Post-Graduation Work Permit Program (PGWPP) allows students who have graduated from a participating Canadian post-secondary institution to gain valuable Canadian work experience. Skilled Canadian work experience gained through the PGWPP potentially helps graduates qualify for permanent residence in Canada through the Canadian Experience Class (CEC). 

Facts & Figures 2013 had previously counted those who held Post-Graduation Work Permits as Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes. However, Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes is a category for individuals who are primarily students and who are also allowed to get a work permit (e.g., Co-op students) because it is integral to their course of studies. To get a PGWP, in contrast, an individual must have ceased to be a student – it is a requirement that the individual must have graduated from their program."

1519,"This entry provides access to the figures and data tables that feature in the CSAS Research Document titled 'Optical, chemical, and biological oceanographic conditions on the Scotian Shelf and in the eastern Gulf of Maine in 2013'. Please consult the meta-data text file that accompanies the zip file download for the figure on the data usage policy and appropriate citation. The meta-data file also provides field descriptors and any other information that may be useful in interpreting the data provided in relation to the accompanying imagery. Abstract: Ocean conditions were unusually warm and stratified on the Scotian Shelf in 2012, and the plankton response to the physical environment in 2012 set the initial conditions for the plankton in 2013. In particular, zooplankton biomass and the abundance of the two dominant herbivorous copepod species, Calanus finmarchicus and Pseudocalanus spp., were low, and there appeared to be a shift to a smaller-size phytoplankton community on the Scotian Shelf. In 2013, annual average temperature anomalies were still positive in the Maritimes Region, but less so than in 2012, and temperature and stratification anomalies were marked by strong sub-annual and mesoscale variability. Variability in the physical environment was reflected in nutrient and plankton conditions. Annual average deep-water and winter surface nitrate inventories were similar to average overall, but surface nitrate was higher than average. The magnitude of the spring bloom chlorophyll peak was above average on the Eastern Scotian Shelf (ESS) and below average on the Western Scotian Shelf (WSS) and in the eastern Gulf of Maine, but summer-fall blooms were above average in all areas. Zooplankton biomass and abundance were lower than average on the eastern transects, but anomalies were mixed on the Central Scotian Shelf, ESS and Bay of Fundy. The abundance of Pseudocalanus spp. was higher than average in the central and western part of the region. Although C. finmarchicus abundance was variable and lower than average overall, it was high on the WSS and in the eastern Gulf of Maine during the summer ecosystem trawl survey and higher than average at the Halifax-2 station and in Emerald Basin in autumn, suggesting a return to more typical abundances in the western part of the region at the end of 2013. Similar to the broader Scotian Shelf, the 2013 Bedford Basin annual average temperature was warmer than normal but not as warm as 2012. Small phytoplankton were more abundant than average in Bedford Basin and large phytoplankton less abundant. An initial evaluation of relationships among annual anomalies of physical variables, nitrate, spring bloom metrics and zooplankton at Halifax-2 from 1999 to 2013 identified bloom duration and enhanced upwelling as important correlates of zooplankton biomass and dominant copepod abundance at an annual scale. Continuous Plankton Recorder sampling showed that observations of phytoplankton bloom dynamics and abundance of C. finmarchicus at Halifax-2 in 2012 were representative of shelf-wide patterns. http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/Publications/ResDocs-DocRech/2014/2014_104-eng.html"

Therefore, where higher velocity (e.g. clay) layers may overlie lower velocity (e.g. sand or gravel) layers, seismic refraction may yield incorrect results. In addition, since seismic refraction requires geophone arrays with lengths of approximately 4 to 5 times the depth to the density contrast of interest (e.g. the top of bedrock), seismic refraction is commonly limited (as a matter of practicality) to mapping layers only where they occur at depths less than 100 feet."

It provides geospatial digital data compliant with the NHN Standard such as lakes, reservoirs, watercourses (rivers and streams), canals, islands, drainage linear network, toponyms or geographical names, constructions and obstacles related to surface waters, etc. The best available federal and provincial data are used for its production, which is done jointly by the federal and interested provincial and territorial partners. The NHN is created from existing data at the 1:50 000 scale or better. In particular, the modeling work of the NHN was based in part on Linear Reference System (LRS) concepts. This approach allows the management of geometric representation separately from attribute information (referred to as event in LRS). Unique Identifiers are associated with each geometric and event object. These IDs (called National Identifiers - NIDs) will lead to more efficient management of updates between data producers and data users. The NHN data have a great potential for analysis, cartographic representation and display and will serve as base data in many applications. The NHN Work Unit Limits were created based on Water Survey of Canada Sub-Sub-Drainage Area."

Starting in 2009, the Earth Observation Team of the Science and Technology Branch (STB) at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) began the process of generating annual crop type digital maps. Focusing on the Prairie Provinces in 2009 and 2010, a Decision Tree (DT) based methodology was applied using optical (Landsat-5, AWiFS, DMC) and radar (Radarsat-2) based satellite images. Beginning with the 2011 growing season, this activity has been extended to other provinces in support of a national crop inventory. To date this approach can consistently deliver a crop inventory that meets the overall target accuracy of at least 85% at a final spatial resolution of 30m (56m in 2009 and 2010)."

2356,"The Air Pollutant Emission Inventory (APEI) is an annual report of air pollutant emissions across Canada published by Environment and Climate Change Canada. The report details the release of air pollutants from all known of sources since 1990. The APEI serves many purposes, including:

-supporting the development of air quality management strategies, policies and regulations.
-fulfilling Canada’s domestic and international reporting obligations.
-informing Canadians about pollutants that affect their health and the environment.
-providing data to support air quality forecasting.

Emissions data is available for the following 17 air pollutants for the years 1990-2014:

Criteria air contaminants (CACs):
-Total particulate matter (TPM)
-Particulate matter less than or equal to 10 microns (PM10)
-Particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 microns (PM2.5)
-Sulphur oxides (SOx)
-Nitrogen oxides (NOx)
-Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
-Carbon monoxide (CO)
-Ammonia (NH3)

Heavy metals: 
-Mercury (Hg)
-Lead (Pb)
-Cadmium (Cd)

Persistent organic pollutants (POPs): 
-Dioxins and furans (D/F)
-Four polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) compounds (Benzo[a]pyrene, Benzo[b]fluoranthene, Benzo[k]fluoranthene and Indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene)
-Hexachlorobenzene (HCB)

This data record breaks down the 1993 emissions of all reported pollutants for Canada by province and territory. To view historical trends of individual substances, please visit the Air Pollutant Emission Inventory Historical Trends data record. To perform more customized selections of APEI data, please visit our website to use our interactive query tool.

The Air Pollutant Emission Inventory is compiled from many different data sources. Emissions data reported by individual facilities to Environment and Climate Change Canada’s National Pollutant Release Inventory are supplemented with well documented, science-based estimation tools to quantify total emissions. Together these data sources provide a comprehensive overview of pollutant emissions across Canada."

Kernel density analysis was used to identify high concentrations and the area occupied by successive catch weight thresholds was used to identify aggregations. These analyses were performed for each of the five biogeographic zones of eastern Canada. The largest sea pen fields were found in the Laurentian Channel as it cuts through the Gulf of St. Lawrence, while large gorgonian coral forests were found in the Eastern Arctic and on the northern Labrador continental slope. Large ball-shaped Geodia spp. sponges were located along the continental slopes north of the Grand Banks, while on the Scotian Shelf a unique population of the large barrel-shaped sponge Vazella pourtalesi was identified. The latitude and longitude marking the positions of all tows which form these and other dense aggregations are provided along with the positions of all tows which captured black coral, a non-aggregating taxon which is long-lived and vulnerable to fishing pressures.  These polygons identify sea pen fields from the broader distribution of sea pens in the Northern Gulf region as sampled by Campelen trawl gear in the Gulf biogeographic zone. A 7 kg minimum threshold for the sea pen catch was identified as the weight that separated the sea pen field habitat from the broader distribution of sea pens with these research vessel tow data and gear type."

This analysis was based on temperature values interpolated at 10 km using the ANUSPLIN method, based on data from the Ministère du Développement durable, de l'Environnement et des Parcs du Québec and from Environment Canada.The water inflow provided by precipitation is an index used in a number of production sectors, to manage plot irrigation, evaluation of the agricultural potential of a given region and leaching of pesticides, for example. Accumulated precipitation in the form of rain can be calculated on an annual or monthly basis or over a specific period: for example, from April to October to correspond generally with the growing season. Quantities of rain are thus calculated for a selected territory on a variable time scale. It is important that careful attention be paid to the scale when interpreting the observed weather data. As an example, the accumulation of small quantities of rain on a regular basis over a long period may be equivalent to a higher amount of rain falling during a shorter period, but the impact on the crop is not the same."

The historical background radiation dose data can be found here: http://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/dc69b741-bcd4-4e0c-a3d3-f25bf9f34f03. A transit dosimeter is sent along with the monitoring dosimeter to determine if there is a significant dose recorded by the dosimeter while it is in transit to the sampling station. The transit dosimeter is shipped out with a station monitor, and shipped back with the station monitor from the previous quarter. The monitoring dosimeters are deployed over a longer time (around three months) than the transit dosimeters (around 3 weeks). This difference largely explains the lower recorded dose values for the transit dosimeter. The results provided for the monitoring and transit dosimeters are expressed as absorbed dose calibrated with a cesium source in units of millisieverts (mSv). The accuracy of the dosimeters is estimated to be ± 15%. The external dose can be attributed almost exclusively to natural radiation (of terrestrial and cosmic origin) with fluctuations based on several factors including location, soil characteristics, and seasonal changes.

This project aims to apply this ERAF in the Pacific Region to the Pacific North Coast Integrated Management Area (PNCIMA) as a pilot project to assess the feasibility and suitability of the ERAF as a tool for determining risk of harm to ecosystem components, and its usefulness for providing transparent and defensible science-based advice on prioritising ecological risk of different activities for ecosystem-based management and MPA management. Because it is based on a subset of SECs and stressors affecting PNCIMA and the resulting scores have not been vetted by experts, the results of this pilot application should not be used for policy or management decisions at this stage."

728,"Facts and Figures 2015: Immigration Overview Temporary Residents presents the annual intake of permit holders and refugee claimants from 1994 to 2015.
 The report also shows the total count of permit holders and refugee claimants with valid permit(s) in each calendar year and the total count of permit holders and refugee claimants as at December 31st of each year. The main body of the publication consists of a series of statistical tables and charts covering the ten-year period from 2006 to 2015.
 In Facts & Figures 2015 for Temporary Residents, numbers on International Mobility Program (IMP) Work Permit Holders for Work Purposes increased due to the moving of the Post-graduate Employment Work Permit Holders population from Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes to Work Permit Holders for Work Purposes under the International Mobility Program. As a result of this, the Facts & Figures 2015 reports reflect a corresponding decrease in the number of Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes. These changes have been applied retroactively.
 The Post-Graduation Work Permit Program (PGWPP) allows students who have graduated from a participating Canadian post-secondary institution to gain valuable Canadian work experience. Skilled Canadian work experience gained through the PGWPP potentially helps graduates qualify for permanent residence in Canada through the Canadian Experience Class (CEC). 

Facts & Figures 2013 had previously counted those who held Post-Graduation Work Permits as Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes. However, Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes is a category for individuals who are primarily students and who are also allowed to get a work permit (e.g., Co-op students) because it is integral to their course of studies. To get a PGWP, in contrast, an individual must have ceased to be a student – it is a requirement that the individual must have graduated from their program."

It is calculated as the mean area (km²) with sea level pressure <= 100.5 kPa and expressed as an anomaly from the 1950-1997 mean. A positive index value reflects a relatively strong or intense Aleutian Low. The index was completely regenerated using a new method in 2015. The new method produces ALPI values that are comparable to previously published values (1900-2008), and there is no difference in the periods with positive or negative values. To make use of this index, you are requested to cite the manuscript (below).

-supporting the development of air quality management strategies, policies and regulations.
-fulfilling Canada’s domestic and international reporting obligations.
-informing Canadians about pollutants that affect their health and the environment.
-providing data to support air quality forecasting.

Emissions data is available for the following 17 air pollutants for the years 1990-2014:

Criteria air contaminants (CACs):
-Total particulate matter (TPM)
-Particulate matter less than or equal to 10 microns (PM10)
-Particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 microns (PM2.5)
-Sulphur oxides (SOx)
-Nitrogen oxides (NOx)
-Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
-Carbon monoxide (CO)
-Ammonia (NH3)

Heavy metals: 
-Mercury (Hg)
-Lead (Pb)
-Cadmium (Cd)

Persistent organic pollutants (POPs): 
-Dioxins and furans (D/F)
-Four polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) compounds (Benzo[a]pyrene, Benzo[b]fluoranthene, Benzo[k]fluoranthene and Indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene)
-Hexachlorobenzene (HCB)

This data record breaks down the 1997 emissions of all reported pollutants for Canada by province and territory. To view historical trends of individual substances, please visit the Air Pollutant Emission Inventory Historical Trends data record. To perform more customized selections of APEI data, please visit our website to use our interactive query tool.

The Air Pollutant Emission Inventory is compiled from many different data sources. Emissions data reported by individual facilities to Environment and Climate Change Canada’s National Pollutant Release Inventory are supplemented with well documented, science-based estimation tools to quantify total emissions.

This legend is principally based on the legend described in following publication: EOSD publication: EOSD Land Cover Classification Legend Report, on which CFS and AAFC collaborated. Some classes related to Northern environments where added in order to meet the interpretation of the Northern land cover classification experts. Land Cover vector data are closest as possible to the source (original raster data). Slight differences can occur because the raster data goes through a data portrayal before being vectorized in order to enhance visual representation such as minimum size, smoothness of polygons and geometry."

Facts & Figures 2013 had previously counted those who held Post-Graduation Work Permits as Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes. However, Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes is a category for individuals who are primarily students and who are also allowed to get a work permit (e.g., Co-op students) because it is integral to their course of studies. To get a PGWP, in contrast, an individual must have ceased to be a student – it is a requirement that the individual must have graduated from their program."

2357,"The Air Pollutant Emission Inventory (APEI) is an annual report of air pollutant emissions across Canada published by Environment and Climate Change Canada. The report details the release of air pollutants from all known of sources since 1990. The APEI serves many purposes, including:

-supporting the development of air quality management strategies, policies and regulations.
-fulfilling Canada’s domestic and international reporting obligations.
-informing Canadians about pollutants that affect their health and the environment.
-providing data to support air quality forecasting.

Emissions data is available for the following 17 air pollutants for the years 1990-2014:

Criteria air contaminants (CACs):
-Total particulate matter (TPM)
-Particulate matter less than or equal to 10 microns (PM10)
-Particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 microns (PM2.5)
-Sulphur oxides (SOx)
-Nitrogen oxides (NOx)
-Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
-Carbon monoxide (CO)
-Ammonia (NH3)

Heavy metals: 
-Mercury (Hg)
-Lead (Pb)
-Cadmium (Cd)

Persistent organic pollutants (POPs): 
-Dioxins and furans (D/F)
-Four polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) compounds (Benzo[a]pyrene, Benzo[b]fluoranthene, Benzo[k]fluoranthene and Indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene)

Kernel density analysis was used to identify high concentrations and the area occupied by successive catch weight thresholds was used to identify aggregations. These analyses were performed for each of the five biogeographic zones of eastern Canada. The largest sea pen fields were found in the Laurentian Channel as it cuts through the Gulf of St. Lawrence, while large gorgonian coral forests were found in the Eastern Arctic and on the northern Labrador continental slope. Large ball-shaped Geodia spp. sponges were located along the continental slopes north of the Grand Banks, while on the Scotian Shelf a unique population of the large barrel-shaped sponge Vazella pourtalesi was identified. The latitude and longitude marking the positions of all tows which form these and other dense aggregations are provided along with the positions of all tows which captured black coral, a non-aggregating taxon which is long-lived and vulnerable to fishing pressures.  These polygons identify sea pen fields from the broader distribution of seapens in the region as sampled by Alfredo trawl gear in the Eastern Arctic biogeographic zone. A 0.25 kg minimum threshold for the sea pen catch was identified as the weight that separated the sea pen field habitat from the broader distribution of sea pens with these research vessel tow data and gear type."

Other authority codes (non-appropriated authorities) are also established by central agencies to facilitate the identification of various accounting transactions that do not require the use of appropriations. An appropriation is an authority of Parliament to pay money out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF) and as such, provides parliamentarians with control over most expenditures of the government. As a general rule, transactions are recorded against an appropriation on an expenditure basis; however, there are certain expenditures that are not charged to an appropriation until a payment is required. The authority code identify expenditures transactions as follows: Statutory expenditures Statutory expenditures are those that Parliament has approved through legislation (other than Appropriations Act) that set out the purpose of the expenditures and the terms and conditions under which they may be made. Non-statutory expenditures are those that Parliament approves annually through an Appropriation Act. Once approved the vote wording and the expenditure authority attributable to each vote become the governing conditions under which these expenditures may be made. Non-appropriated transactions Non-appropriated authority codes identify accounting transactions that do not require the use of appropriations (i.e., expenditure or revenue are already recognized [e.g., amortization expense or the receipt of revenue credited to vote] or expenditure is not charged to appropriations until the payment is required [e.g., severance pay])."

All facilities that emit the equivalent of 50 kilotonnes or more of GHGs in carbon dioxide equivalent units per year are required to submit a report. 

Facility GHG emissions reporting contributes to the development, implementation and evaluation of climate change and energy use policies and strategies by providing a more precise picture of the sources and amounts of GHG emissions from Canada's largest emitters.

Emissions data are available by gas, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) (given in tonnes and tonnes of CO2 equivalent of each gas), for each facility and each year in the time series (2004-2014). 

Note: All facility data expressed in CO2 equivalent values incorporate revised global warming potential (GWP) values that are now used internationally for GHG reporting. Facility emissions data reported in previous years (i.e., 2004-2012) were recalculated accordingly."

2101,"Carbon fluxes and concentrations (carbon dioxide, CO2, and methane, CH4) were measured in various aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems across the eastern Canadian Arctic. Firstly, this study aimed to quantify summer CO2 and CH4 emissions for the full range of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in the subarctic zone, more exactly in the Kuujjuarapik area, and to examine the importance of limnology, vegetation cover and underlying substrate on spatial variations in C emissions. Emissions of CO2 and CH4 were measured using a static flux chamber (SFC) and concentrations were determined by dual detector gas chromatography. These fluxes were then scaled by cover type to give a first estimate of this subarctic region's landscape scale summer emissions of CO2 and CH4. Secondly, another objective of this research was to determine net ecosystem exchange (NEE) in the eastern Canadian subarctic ecosystems, more precisely over shrub vegetation in forest tundra, and to examine the implication of climatic factors, such as precipitation and temperature, on annual and seasonal variability. An open path Eddy Covariance System, including 3D anemometer, CO2/H2O open path infrared gas analyzer and specific meteorological sensors were used for continuous in situ measurements. Carbon dioxide exchanges were then compiled to give a first estimate of NEE budget of this subarctic region. Finally, we aimed to compare soil C content with the general trends of CO2 exchange along a gradient spanning 55° to 73°N in the Canadian eastern Arctic and to relate this to spatial trends in vegetation communities. Emissions of CO2 and CH4 over soil were measured using a static flux chamber (SFC) and concentrations were determined by dual detector gas chromatography and infrared analyzer. NEE were measured using BOWEN RATIO systems, and closed path infrared analyzer. The data set includes measurements from Kuujjuarapik, Umiujaq, Pond Inlet and Bylot Island (2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009)."

2942,"This data set consists of greyscale reliefs created from digital multibeam bathymetry data collected by the Geological Survey of Canada (Atlantic). Multibeam bathymetry surveys use sonar to map the seafloor. Sound is transmitted toward the seabed in beams formed using an array of piezoelectric transducers and as the vessel moves through the water, the acoustic signals or ""pings"" bounce back off the seabed returning up to the water surface where they are detected by the transducer and recorded on board. Measurement of acoustic velocity variations in the water column permit conversion of  ""ping"" return time to water depth. Compilation and processing of these soundings within a Geographic Information System (GIS) yields a 3-dimensional digital elevation model (DEM) of the seafloor. The individual surveys cover areas of particular interest to the marine geoscientists at the Geological Survey of Canada (Atlantic)."

The georeferenced maps can be used in a Geographic Information System (GIS). In all cases, they accurately represent the topographical data available for the date indicated (validity date). The combination of CanMatrix and CanTopo data provides complete national coverage. • CanMatrix - Print Ready: Raster maps produced by scanning topographic maps at scales from 1:25 000 to 1:1 000 000. This product is not georeferenced. Validity dates: 1944 to 2005 (1980 on average). Available formats: PDF and TIFF • CanMatrix - Georeferenced: Raster maps produced by scanning topographic maps at scales of 1:50 000 and 1:250 000. These maps are georeferenced according to the 1983 North American Reference System (NAD 83).
 Validity dates: 1944 to 2005 (1980 on average). Available format: GeoTIFF • CanTopo: Digital raster maps produced mainly from the GeoBase initiative, NRCan digital topographic data, and other sources. Approximately 2,234 datasets (maps) at scale of 1:50 000, primarily covering northern Canada, are available. CanTopo datasets in GeoPDF and GeoTIFF format are georeferenced according to the 1983 North American Reference System (NAD 83). Validity dates: 1946 to 2012 (2007 on average).

2146,"In support of the Chemicals Management Plan, a wastewater monitoring program was initiated in 2009 to generate data on priorities substances that may be released to the environment.  On December 8, 2006, the Government of Canada unveiled the Chemicals Management Plan (CMP) which takes action regarding chemicals that are harmful to human health or the environment.  One element of the CMP is Monitoring and Surveillance, which generates data on the presence and levels of chemical substances in environmental matrices.  These data are used to make risk assessment and risk management decisions regarding the best approach to protect Canadians and their environment from risks these substances might pose.  

The wastewater sector has been identified as a possible release point to the environment for certain CMP substances.  The purpose of the wastewater monitoring program is to gather information from representative municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) across Canada to determine the levels of selected chemical substances (such as Bisphenol A, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, flame retardants, heavy metals, etc) entering WWTPs, the fate of these substances through various typical wastewater and sludge treatment processes (primary treatment, activated sludge treatment, lagoon treatment, etc.) at warm and cold process temperatures, and levels of these substances being discharged in WWTP effluents and solids residuals. The participation of various WWTPs in this program is done on a voluntary and anonymous basis, and sampling can only commence once a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) has been signed by the Municipality and Environment and Climate Change Canada.  The results from this monitoring project will be used to improve our understanding and prediction of the fate of chemical substances during wastewater treatment and to determine if control measures are needed to prevent these substances from entering the municipal wastewater system."

2570,"This dataset provides the results obtained by Health Canada’s Radiological Monitoring Network (CRMN) for tritium content in atmospheric water vapor sampled from monitoring stations in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick. More information about the CRMN network can be found here: http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/contaminants/radiation/crmn-rcsr/index-eng.php The results provided are for tritium activity concentration, expressed in units of becquerels per cubic meter (Bq/m3). Atmospheric water is sampled monthly for determination of tritium content. The majority of such monitoring activity occurs in close proximity to nuclear power plants. Until 1996, Health Canada monitored the areas near Darlington, Bruce and Pickering in Ontario, Gentilly in Quebec, and Point Lepreau in New Brunswick. In 1996, Health Canada’s monitoring of the Ontario stations was terminated to avoid redundancy, since a similar initiative was underway through the Ontario Ministry of Labour. Currently, the CRMN monitors six sites in the vicinity of Point Lepreau, four sites in the vicinity of Gentilly, and a single site in the Greater Toronto Area. The average tritium concentration for the CRMN stations is 0.22 Bq/m3 for the time period from 2004 to 2013. This is consistent with results reported for other monitoring stations in close proximity to Canadian nuclear power stations, and the levels are considered to be safe from a health perspective. Note that the tritium values are measured using liquid scintillator measurements. This requires removing the background contribution from the measurement. The uncertainty associated with each measurement, can lead to reported values of less than zero."
