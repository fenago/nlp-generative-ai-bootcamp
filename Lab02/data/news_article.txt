Ever since the populist Law and Justice (pis) party took power in 2015, Adam Bodnar, Poland’s
 human-rights ombudsman, has been warning against its relentless efforts to get control of the
 courts. To illustrate the danger, he uses an expression from communist times: lex telefonica.
 In the Polish People’s Republic, verdicts were routinely dictated by a phone call from an
 apparatchik at party headquarters. Today’s government has more subtle techniques,
 but the goal is the same, Mr Bodnar says: “If a judge has a case on his desk with some
 political importance, he should be afraid.”

The European Commission is worried, too. It accuses pis of violating Poland’s commitments
to the rule of law under the European Union’s founding treaty. In 2017 the commission took
Poland to the European Court of Justice (ecj) over laws that gave politicians control over
appointing judges. (For example, they lowered judges’ retirement age while letting the justice
 minister pick whom to exempt.) The ecj ruled against the Poles, who had in the meantime
 scrapped some of the measures.
