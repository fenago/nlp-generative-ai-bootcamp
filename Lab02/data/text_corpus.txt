New Zealand players Jesse Tashkoff and Joey Field won hearts on Wednesday after they helped carry injured West Indies batsman Kirk McKenzie off the field during their U-19 World Cup quarterfinal.

McKenzie was suffering from cramps on his leg and was forced to retire hurt on 99, but courageously decided to return to face the final 14 deliveries of the innings after West Indies had lost their ninth wicket.

After struggling to hobble back to the middle, however, he was dismissed first ball -- still one short of his century.

Cue the intervention of the sportsmanlike Kiwi duo, who carried the badly-cramped McKenzie off the field while being applauded back to the pavilion by the fans at Benoni's Willowmoore Park in South Africa.

The gesture was applauded by the cricketing fraternity with India vice-captain Rohit Sharma also praising the New Zealand players.

"So good to see this #SpiritOfCricket at its best," Rohit tweeted along with the video of the incident.

New Zealand meanwhile, rode on Kristian Clarke and Joey Field's all-round performances to make it to the semi-finals of the U-19 World Cup by beating the Windies by 2 wickets, chasing down the target of 239 with 2 balls to spare.

The Black Caps relied on Kristian Clarke and Joey Field's unbeaten 86-run 9th-wicket partnership to cross the finish line in the final over. Clarke and Field both remained unbeaten on 46 and 38 respectively.

Both medium pacers were also among the wickets for the Kiwis with Clarke taking 4 while Field bagged 2. The Windies, who entered the game unbeaten through the competition, were bowled out for 238 in 47.5 overs with McKenzie's 99 being their highest score.

New Zealand will now face the winner of the match between hosts South Africa and Bangladesh in the semifinals.
